# Tkinter-Calender-project
The calendar project using tkinter is a simple example of how to create a GUI application that displays a calendar and allows the user to navigate to different months. With some additional customization, such as adding events or allowing the user to select a date, this project could be expanded into a more fully-featured calendar application.
